When you run python ./debug/data_model.py wrong, you saw these two errrors: (correct way to run is python data_model.py correct)

1. the data_generator is not working appropriately.
2. Since the data is not shuffled, the training accuracy is is close to zero. (Because in each folder, only one catetory is there.
