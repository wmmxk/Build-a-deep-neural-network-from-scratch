You compared parsing a paramter using tf.flags or parser.

tf.flags
  You don't have to pickle.dump the flags and load it when you run the code in an IDE rather than from command line.
  Just set the default value to be the ones you pass from command line.

parser.args
  It also works without passing a value from the command line.
